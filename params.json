RouteYou (www.routeyou.com) is a innovative, flemisch company active in the field of recreational navigation. The production and translation of raw route-information towards digital structured data is a key component of the production process. The focus of RouteYou is mainly outdoor navigation for tourists, hikers, cyclists and motor bikers by the production of routes and route-networks which allow route-planning and turn-by-turn navigation for this target market.\r\n\r\nUnder a Bakeland mandate (IWT - Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology), he is currently pursuing his doctoral studies in close collaboration with RouteYou and University Ghent (2013-2016). These doctoral studies focus on an intelligent aggregation and combination of a vast set of geodata sources, aimed on the creation of novel context and content information for recreational navigation purposes. Special focus is placed on geodata produced by non-professional end users originating from community tools and mobile devices (e.g. RouteYou, OpenStreetMap, outdoor navigation devices like Garmin or Mio, Smartphones ...) and semantic web technologies.\r\n\r\nHis research interest is mainly in the fields of crowd-sourcing, geospatial modeling, GIS, (recreational) geodata and semantic web technologies.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
