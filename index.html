<p>Kevin Baker (Â°1987, Kortrijk) holds a master degree in geography, received from the University of Ghent, and is presently working at RouteYou (2011 - present) responsible for geomatics and GIS.  RouteYou (<a href="http://www.routeyou.com">www.routeyou.com</a>) is a innovative, flemisch company active in the field of recreational navigation. The production and translation of raw route-information towards digital structured data is a key component of the production process. The focus of RouteYou is mainly outdoor navigation for tourists, hikers, cyclists and motor bikers by the production of routes and route-networks which allow route-planning and turn-by-turn navigation for this target market.</p>

<p>Under a Bakeland mandate (IWT - Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology), he is currently pursuing his doctoral studies in close collaboration with RouteYou and University Ghent (2013-2016). These doctoral studies focus on an intelligent aggregation and combination of a vast set of geodata sources, aimed on the creation of novel context and content information for recreational navigation purposes. Special focus is placed on geodata produced by non-professional end users originating from community tools and mobile devices (e.g. RouteYou, OpenStreetMap, outdoor navigation devices like Garmin or Mio, Smartphones ...) and semantic web technologies.</p>

<p>His research interest is mainly in the fields of crowd-sourcing, geospatial modeling, GIS, (recreational) geodata and semantic web technologies.</p>
